The teams that manage to solve all the questions correctly within assigned time will proceed to the next round",

The decrypted clues of the first round will reveal the idea that has to be coded in the second round. The first 20 teams which get the highest number of correct outputs in the assigned time will be qualified to the third round",
        round3: "Based on the output of the second round, The teams have to perform file mining in the given git repository and dig through many folders and files to get snippets of algorithm to qualify to the final round.They need to arrange the algorithm in proper order.The first 5 teams to complete this round will qualify to the final round",
